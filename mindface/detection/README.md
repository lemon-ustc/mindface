## Introduction
MindSpore is a new generation of full-scenario AI computing framework launched by Huawei in August 2019 and released On March 28, 2020.

RetinaFace is a practical single-stage SOTA face detector which is accepted by [CVPR 2020](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/html/Deng_RetinaFace_Single-Shot_Multi-Level_Face_Localisation_in_the_Wild_CVPR_2020_paper.html). 


This repository is the mindspore implementation of RetinaFace and has achieved great performance. We implemented two versions based on ResNet50 and MobileNet0.25 to meet different needs.

## Quick Start
1. Installation

    1.1 Git clone this [repo](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindface.git) and install mindface.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindface.git
    cd mindface
    python setup.py install
    ```

    1.2 Install dependencies

    ```
    cd mindface/detection/
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Prepare Data

    2.1. Download WIDERFACE dataset and annotations that we used from [baidu cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1eET2kirYbyM04Bg1s12K5g?pwd=jgcf) or [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pBHUJRWepXZj-X3Brm0O-nVhTchH11YY/view?usp=sharing).
    


    2.2. Organise the dataset directory under mindface/detection/ as follows:
    ```
    data/WiderFace/
        train/
            images/
            label.txt
        val/
            images/
            label.txt
        ground_truth/
            wider_easy_val.mat
            wider_medium_val.mat
            wider_hard_val.mat
            wider_face_val.mat
    ```
3. Set Config File

    You can Modify the parameters of the config file in ```./configs```.

    We provide two versions of configs ([RetinaFace_mobilenet025](./configs/RetinaFace_mobilenet025.yaml) and [RetinaFace_resnet50](./configs/RetinaFace_resnet50.yaml)).


4. Train

```
    python mindface/detection/train.py --config mindface/detection/configs/RetinaFace_mobilenet025.yaml
```
> note: if your device is Ascend, please set the "device_target" in config file as "Ascend".
5. Eval
```
    python eval.py --config mindface/detection/configs/RetinaFace_mobilenet025.yaml --checkpoint pretrained/weight.ckpt
```

6. Predict
```
    python infer.py --config mindface/detection/configs/RetinaFace_mobilenet025.yaml --checkpoint pretrained/weight.ckpt --image_path ./imgs/0000.jpg --conf 0.5
```



## RetinaFace Pretrained Models
You can download our pretrained model of [RetinaFace-ResNet50](https://download.mindspore.cn/toolkits/mindface/retinaface/RetinaFace_ResNet50.ckpt) and  [RetinaFace-MobileNet025](https://download.mindspore.cn/toolkits/mindface/retinaface/RetinaFace_MobileNet025.ckpt).

You can verify the results in the [table](#widerface-val-performance-in-single-scale-when-using-resnet50-as-backbone-net) with the downloaded pretrained model.
